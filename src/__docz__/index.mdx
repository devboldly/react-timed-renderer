👁️ **[Live Demo](/TimedRenderer#example)**

## Overview

A component that re-renders at regular intervals.

Just provide the interval in milliseconds and a render prop.

The built-in [precision timer](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-precision-timer/) will handle the rest!

### Features include:

- **🙌 Simple and easy**
  - Render components at timed intervals with ease.
- **🎯 Precise timing**
  - Underlying timer is both accurate and precise.
- **🧰 Versatile**
  - A useful tool to have in your React toolkit.

## Installation

```
npm i react-timed-renderer
```

## Quick Start

```jsx
import { TimedRenderer } from 'react-timed-renderer';
```

```jsx
<TimedRenderer
  interval={1000}
  render={time => (
    <div>Rendered at: {time}</div>
  )}
/>
```

Provide an interval in milliseconds and a render prop. 

The render prop receives a single argument, which is the time (in milliseconds) at which the render occurred, in case that's useful to you.

See the [demo](/TimedRenderer#example) for an interactive example using CSS transitions.

## TypeScript

Type definitions have been included for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) support.
